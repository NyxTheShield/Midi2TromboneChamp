# Midi2TromboneChamp
Create charts for Trombone Champ from midis, to be used with TrombLoader

## Usage
Channel 1 is used for actual notes, while Channel 2 is used for multiple slide notes.
A sequence of Channel 2 notes must end with a Channel 1 note. Also, please quantize your charts, the game hates unquantized notes.

It's strongly advised to make your own MIDI files. Trying to import ones directly from the internet will probably result in a crash or a bunch of bad notes in your chart.

To add a custom chart, create a new folder in the CustomSongs directory created by the TrombLoader plugin using the following structure:

```
[your-song-name] # this is your folder that contains your custom chart materials
│   bg.png # your background image for the song
│   song.tmb # your .tmb file generated by Midi2TromboneChamp
│   song.ogg # your .ogg music file that will play during your song
```

## How It Works
Midi2TromboneChamp exports JSON in the following format that represents a chart:

[note position, note length, start pitch, pitch delta, pitch end]
